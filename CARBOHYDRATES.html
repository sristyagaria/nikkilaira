    <p>A carbohydrate (/kɑːrboʊˈhaɪdreɪt/) is a biomolecule consisting of carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) atoms, usually with a hydrogen–oxygen atom ratio of 2:1 (as in water) and thus with the empirical formula Cm(H2O)n (where m may or may not be different from n). However, not all carbohydrates conform to this precise stoichiometric definition (e.g., uronic acids, deoxy-sugars such as fucose), nor are all chemicals that do conform to this definition automatically classified as carbohydrates (e.g. formaldehyde and acetic acid).</p>

      <li><strong>NUTRITION</strong></li>
      <p>Carbohydrates, or carbs, are sugar molecules. Along with proteins and fats, carbohydrates are one of three main nutrients found in foods and drinks.<br>
         Your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose. Glucose, or blood sugar, is the main source of energy for your body's cells, tissues, and organs.</p>
         <li><strong>STRUCTURE</strong></li>
         <p>Carbohydrates consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The general empirical structure for carbohydrates is (CH2O)n.<br>
            They are organic compounds organized in the form of aldehydes or ketones with multiple hydroxyl groups coming off the carbon chain</p>
