    <p> nutrition, biology, and chemistry, fat usually means any ester of fatty acids, or a mixture of such compounds; most commonly those that occur in living beings or in food.[1]
The term often refers specifically to triglycerides (triple esters of glycerol), that are the main components of vegetable oils and of fatty tissue in animals;[2] or, even more narrowly, to triglycerides that are solid or semisolid at room temperature, thus excluding oils. <br>
The term may also be used more broadly as a synonym of lipidâ€”any substance of biological relevance, composed of carbon, hydrogen, or oxygen, that is insoluble in water but soluble in non-polar solvents.<br>
[1] In this sense, besides the triglycerides, the term would include several other types of compounds like mono- and diglycerides, phospholipids (such as lecithin), sterols (such as cholesterol), waxes (such as beeswax),[1] and free fatty acids, which are usually present in human diet in smaller amounts.[2]</p>

  <li><strong>NUTRITION</strong></li>
  <p>Fat also helps you absorb vitamins A, D, E, and K, the so-called fat-soluble vitamins.<br>
     Fat also fills your fat cells and insulates your body to help keep you warm. The fats your body gets from your food give your body essential fatty acids called linoleic and linolenic acid.</p>
     <li><strong>STRUCTURE</strong></li>

     <p>
     A fatty acid is made up of a chain of carbon atoms, with a methyl group at one end and an acid group at the other .<br>
      Attached to the carbon chain are hydrogen atoms, the number per carbon atom depending on whether the fatty acid is 'saturated' or 'unsaturated</p>
