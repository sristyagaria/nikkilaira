      <p>Generally, we can stick all of the vitamins into two broad categories. The fat soluble vitamins, vitamins A, D E, and K, can be stored by our bodies in the liver or in fatty tissues. They are stored until they're required, which consequently means they generally don't need to be ingested as frequently
